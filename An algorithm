Algorithm
This program shows how an algorithm can work for part of a vacuum*/
/*
My algorithm will be a battery check.
1. Either human will turn me on or it is my scheduled time to turn on. SEQUENCE
2. Is my battery at least 80%? If not, STOP recharge, once battery is charged to 80% continue. SELECTION
3. Check to see if my bag is full. Bag must not be full to continue. SEQUENCE
4. Turn on suction and brushes. SEQUENCE
5. Move throughout the area to vacuum. SEQUENCE
6. Have battery alert me at 15%.SUBPROGRAM
7. Turn off suction and brushes.SUBPROGRAM
8. Remember what I have already done. SUBPROGRAM
9. Go to recharging station. SEQUENCE
10. Touch recharging station to recharge. SEQUENCE
11. Have battery alert me at 80%. SUBPROGRM
12. Repeat steps 2-12 until area is vacuumed. LOOP
13. Once area is vacuumed, go to recharge station. SELECTION
14. Have battery alert me at 100%. SELECTION
15. Power off. SEQUENCE
Test Case
Battery is at 100% anytime = I am good to go! Begin/continue vacuuming.
Battery is at 80% anytime = I am good to go! Begin/continue vacuuming.
Battery is at 78% at turn on = I must recharge! Stay and recharge to 80%.
Battery is at 42% during vacuuming = Keep going! Continue vacuuming.
Battery is at 12% at any time = I must recharge! Stop vacuuming, shut down suction and brushes, Go recharge to 80%.
                                OR Don't start vacuuming. Charge to 80%.
Battery is at 15% during vacuuming = I must recharge! Stop vacuuming, shut down suction and brushes, Go recharge to 80%
